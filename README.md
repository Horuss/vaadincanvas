## What's this?

This is a server-side Vaadin add-on for the HTML5 canvas. You add the ```Canvas``` component to your Vaadin UI, and can then draw on it using the Java API.

## Compatibility

This add-on is compatible with Vaadin 7 RC2 and up. A canvas add-on for Vaadin 6 is available [here](https://vaadin.com/add-on/canvaswidget)

## Installation

Install the add-on to your Vaadin project by simply copying the JAR file from [Vaadin Directory](https://vaadin.com/addon/canvas) and *compiling your widgetset* (more details [here](https://vaadin.com/directory/help/using-vaadin-add-ons)). Or alternatively you can add the add-on to your project using Maven (see the Maven POM snippet required from [Vaadin Directory](https://vaadin.com/addon/canvas)).
